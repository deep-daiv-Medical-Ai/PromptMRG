Also, with noted subcutaneous air over the right neck, these findings altogether make this concerning for bronchopleural fistulous formation between the right pleural space and the subcutaneous tissues of the right neck. CXR2: There is a moderate sized right apical pneumothorax with air fluid level within the mid portion of the right hemithorax consistent with a hydropneumothorax. There is opacification along the right lateral thoracic wall with additional right basilar opacification. Again, there is a large subcutaneous collection of air along the soft tissues overlying the right apex. Also noted are multiple riht apical posterior rib fractures unchanged from previous films. Persistent opacification along the lateral aspect of the right lower lung and along the right lung base is consistent with tracking pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis. CT scans: Within the right hemithorax, there is a persistent moderate sized pleural effusion with a focal area of fluid at the right lung apex with an internal air fluid level consistent with loculated hydropneumothorax. Along the anterior aspect of this focal fluid collection there is soft tissue density material with internal air bronchograms as well as heterogeneous low density material which may represent an infarcted portion of the right upper lobe. A prior chest tube tract is appreciated along the anterior lateral aspect of the right thorax. Interval increase in size of the patient’s right apical subcutaneous emphysema as well as increased size of the patient’s right hydropneumothorax consistent with bronchopleural fistula with continued communication to the subcutaneous tissues likely via the posterior apical comminuted rib fractures. Findings also suggestive of lung infarction involving the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe.",

This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads).

There is no pneumothorax. There are continued bibasilar reticulonodular ground glass opacities. AP chest radiograph from hospital day 6, obtained later in the day secondary to new respiratory distress, reveals that the patient has developed a significant left sided pneumothorax, with persistent pneumomediastinum, bibasilar ground-glass reticulonodular opacities, and subcutaneous emphysema surrounding the base of the neck. The patient’s support devices are stable when compared to the prior studies. On hospital day 10 the patient experienced worsening respiratory distress, and an unenhanced CT of the chest was performed.

Steady state free precession is a relatively newer MR pulse sequence that provides good homogeneity of the bright blood pool signal and confirms the aortic dilatation noted on black blood images (Figures C and D). On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) confirmed the dilated ascending aortic root and absence of an aortic dissection or coarctation.",

This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads).

Hospital Day 6: AP chest radiograph from hospital day 6, reveals that the patient has been intubated, and has developed a spontaneous pneumomediastinum with extensive subcutaneous emphysema surrounding the neck. There is no pneumothorax. There are continued bibasilar reticulonodular ground glass opacities. AP chest radiograph from hospital day 6, obtained later in the day secondary to new respiratory distress, reveals that the patient has developed a significant left sided pneumothorax, with persistent pneumomediastinum, bibasilar ground-glass reticulonodular opacities, and subcutaneous emphysema surrounding the base of the neck. The patient’s support devices are stable when compared to the prior studies. On hospital day 10 the patient experienced worsening respiratory distress, and an unenhanced CT of the chest was performed. An axial image at the level of the aortic arch demonstrates continued pneumomediastinum, and a left-sided pneumothorax. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion, with persistent ground-glass opacities. An axial image at the level of the hila demonstrates continued pneumomediastinum, and a left-sided pneumothorax. There are persistent ground-glass opacities with focal areas of consolidation. An axial image at the level of the right hemidiaphragm demonstrates continued pneumomediastinum, and a left-sided pneumothorax.

PA PROTOCOL CHEST CT: FINDINGS: There are sternotomy wires surrounded by bone, suggesting surgery at a young age. There is mirror image anatomy of the heart and upper abdominal organs, findings consistent with the patient\"s known situs inversus. The patient has a left-sided aortic arch with mirror image branching vessels. The right side of the heart is enlarged, as is the main pulmonary artery, which demonstrates some possible focal narrowing just distal to the pulmonic valve. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is focal band-like attenuation in the lower lungs, likely representing bibasilar atelectasis. No bronchiectasis is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with situs inversus with a left aortic arch and mirror image branching vessels. 2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Also, with noted subcutaneous air over the right neck, these findings altogether make this concerning for bronchopleural fistulous formation between the right pleural space and the subcutaneous tissues of the right neck. CXR2: There is a moderate sized right apical pneumothorax with air fluid level within the mid portion of the right hemithorax consistent with a hydropneumothorax. There is opacification along the right lateral thoracic wall with additional right basilar opacification. Again, there is a large subcutaneous collection of air along the soft tissues overlying the right apex. Also noted are multiple riht apical posterior rib fractures unchanged from previous films. Persistent opacification along the lateral aspect of the right lower lung and along the right lung base is consistent with tracking pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis. CT scans: Within the right hemithorax, there is a persistent moderate sized pleural effusion with a focal area of fluid at the right lung apex with an internal air fluid level consistent with loculated hydropneumothorax. Along the anterior aspect of this focal fluid collection there is soft tissue density material with internal air bronchograms as well as heterogeneous low density material which may represent an infarcted portion of the right upper lobe. A prior chest tube tract is appreciated along the anterior lateral aspect of the right thorax. Interval increase in size of the patient’s right apical subcutaneous emphysema as well as increased size of the patient’s right hydropneumothorax consistent with bronchopleural fistula with continued communication to the subcutaneous tissues likely via the posterior apical comminuted rib fractures.
